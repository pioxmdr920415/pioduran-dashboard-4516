# Lucide-React Chunk Loading Error Fix

## Problem Analysis

The error `Loading chunk vendors-node_modules_lucide-react_dist_esm_icons_chevron-down_js-node_modules_lucide-react_di-b2615d failed` indicates that Webpack is creating overly specific chunk names for lucide-react imports, which can cause chunk loading failures in production environments.

## Root Cause

The issue is in the Webpack configuration in `frontend/craco.config.js`. The current vendor chunk naming strategy creates very long and specific chunk names based on the full module path, which can exceed URL length limits and cause loading issues.

## Solution

We need to modify the Webpack configuration to:

1. Simplify the chunk naming strategy for lucide-react specifically
2. Ensure consistent chunk naming that works across different environments
3. Add lucide-react to a specific vendor group to prevent overly long chunk names

## Implementation Plan

1. Update the Webpack configuration in `frontend/craco.config.js`
2. Add a specific cache group for lucide-react icons
3. Simplify the chunk naming strategy
4. Test the build process to ensure chunks are generated correctly

## Technical Details

The current configuration creates chunk names like:
```
vendors-node_modules_lucide-react_dist_esm_icons_chevron-down_js-node_modules_lucide-react_di-b2615d.chunk.js
```

We need to simplify this to something like:
```
vendor.lucide-react.chunk.js
```

This will be achieved by adding a specific cache group for lucide-react in the Webpack splitChunks configuration.
